# lvlupcolor
In tribute to Tetris on the NES (Famicom) this little toy plugin for vim (nvim) changes your color schemes every x lines written in your current buffer. Instead of using a linear spacing between changes a logarithmic scale can be applied.
The following options are available with their given default values:
* `let g:lvlupcolor_use_loglevels = 0`
* `let g:lvlupcolor_lines_per_level = 100`
* `let g:lvlupcolor_schemes = ['darkblue', 'default']`
